# Assignment 9

In this assignment we implemented event-driven system using pipes-and-filters pattern
and message brokers (in this case, RabbitMQ).

## Implementation on top of pipes-and-filters

The implementation of pipes-and-filters is in the `rest-api-pipes-and-filters`
directory. Mainly, it is a single service that can be started using a single `main.py`
file. 

The implementation of different processes-filters is in the `filters` subdirectory.

This entire service requires `.env` file to successfully be started with docker compose.

## Implementation with message brokers

Different services from this implementation are on different directories with
corresponding names
- `filter-service`
- `screaming-service`
- `publish-service`
- `rabbitmq`
- `rest-api`

These services can also be started with single 
docker compose from the root of the project.

## Performance testing

We implemented performance testing allowing us to get a time to process a single request.

Process a single request â€” time from receival a JSON body until sending an email. In order to implement
that we added a new RabbitMQ topic / IPC Queue to allow publisher service "notify" a root endpoint about
successfull processing of a request. It is enabled only in performance testing mode.

`performance-test.sh` script starts all the necessary services, waits some time until startup, and
sends several messages to `/message` endpoint. During all the process it measures total time required for
request processing and prints an average.
